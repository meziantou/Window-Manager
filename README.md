# Window-Manager

You have many windows and some difficulties in positioning them, WindowManager is made for you.

Window Manager lets you move the active window to any side or corner of your screen. Simply use the shortcut Win+Num pad (this is of course editable). If you have multiple screens you can move the foreground window to your next screen. If your screens don't have the same resolution, the window will be resized.
If you need, you can position the active window more finely by selecting the position directly on a virtual grid (alt+space which is also editable).
